/**
 * Request Range
 *
 * Returns the range of dates to request data from.
 *
 * The request range will be a strictly larger range than the view port,
 * which allows the chart to pan and already have data present.
 *
 * DESIGN
 * We have several goals,
 * One should be able to get the same request range, for a wide range of start and end dates:
 * 1. with start/end dates slightly shifted in either direction
 * 2. The duration of time between start and end date becoming larger or smaller.
 *
 * This is important to prevent quick succession of requesting new date.
