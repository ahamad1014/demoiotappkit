/**
 * Predicate Utilities
 *
 * A place for generic predicates. Useful when needing predicates which play nicely
 * with typescript, or other non-trivial predicate logic.
 *
 * Providing smart predicates with built in type guards can give us stronger typing in our business logic.
 * https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Without Type Guards (to be avoided):
 * ```
 * const maybeItems : (Item | null)[] = SOME_MAYBE_ITEMS;
 * const items: Item[] = maybeItems.filter(x => x != null) as Item[];
 * ```
 *
 * With Type Guards:
 * ```
 * const maybeItems : (Item | null)[] = SOME_MAYBE_ITEMS;
 * const items: Item[] = maybeItems.filter(isDefined);
 * ```
 *
 * No type casting necessary :-) all you have to do is trust that the shared predicate properly
 * type guards.
 *
